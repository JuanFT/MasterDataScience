## SQL

During the master we were using the virtual machine which worked perfectly for SQL. However, when I tried to program in SQL in my Mac's Terminal I couln't.

I searched online, and found that some installation was required. The website that I found more clear was  https://www.robinwieruch.de/postgres-sql-macos-setup . After the setup I started to use, just to realize that the Terminal is not a very good tool for adding comments to the code.

Since I already had experience with Jupyter Notebook, I wondered if it would be possible to use it for SQL. I found this website that explained everything very clear for a smooth configuration of Jupyter Notebook https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/postgresql-integration-with-jupyter-notebook-deb97579a38d

Therefore the SQL code can be found in notebooks in this folder.
